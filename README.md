# 42sh {EPITECH PROJECT}

Welcome to 42sh, a Linux terminal in C. Our implementation includes several options that make it a versatile and reliable tool for your everyday use.

One of the key features of 42sh is its ability to handle spaces and tabs seamlessly. Our implementation of $PATH and environment variables ensures that your commands are executed with the correct settings every time.

We've also taken great care to ensure that errors and return values are handled appropriately, so you can trust 42sh to always give you accurate feedback on your commands.

Our implementation of redirections (‘<’, ‘>’, ‘<<’ and ‘>>’) and pipes (‘|’) allows you to manipulate input and output streams with ease. Additionally, we've included a number of useful built-ins, such as cd, echo, exit, setenv, and unsetenv.

Other features of 42sh include separators like ‘;’, ‘&&’, and ‘||’, backticks (“’), support for local and environment variables, a comprehensive history function (‘!’), aliases, and multiline line editing.

We're proud to offer a powerful and reliable terminal emulator that can help streamline your workflow and make your everyday tasks more efficient.

## BONUS:

You can open Sublime Text and edit your command from within by pressing ctrl + e. When you exit the software, if you have saved the modifications, the modified command will be executed and the file will not exist anymore.

Good luck with your project!
